- build byramid class to define prototype for all information inside the data set
- build PyramidCSVDAO class to 
* read pyramid.csv
* Create List of Pyramids objects for each pyramid in the csv file
* validate the values you make all needed conversion.
- build main class and print data of each pyramid

## task 2 :
### deal with Collections
- Develop and application that reads two files for cities and countries and store each in a List.
- Each city entry contains code, name, continent, Surface Area, population
- Create a map that uses the country code as keys and a list of cities as the value for each country.
- For a given country code sort the cities according to the population
- sample of cities data set contains 26568 city

## Lab Exercise 2 :
### deal with lambda expressions 1
- Your goal is to make a method called betterString that takes two Strings and a lambda that says whether the first of the two
is “better”.
- The method should return that better String; i.e., if the function given by the lambda returns true, the betterString method should return the first String, otherwise betterString should return the second String.

### deal with lambda expressions 2
- Given a String, the task is to check whether a string contains only alphabets or not.
- use isLetter() method of Character class.

## Lab Exercise 4 :
### deal with Stream API
- For the given data set used in JUPAI3 compute the median, average, quartile of the dataset based on one of the available
characteristics.
